```

it failed due to proxyError it is trying to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 8080

looking at the code it mentions burp and proxy referring to burp suite

we can run burp suite first then the code will run, other wise just remove the proxy line from requests

After creating the database, change the database configuration found in fuel/application/config/database.php to include your hostname (e.g. localhost), username, password and the database to match the new database you created.
```

search for the file database.php

```
find / -name database.php 2>/dev/null
