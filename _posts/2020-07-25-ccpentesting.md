## Task 4

### What is the name of the hidden directory?

### What is the name of the hidden file with the extension xxa

we run gobuster with the extension .xxa

```
kali@kali:~/Downloads$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.158.196 -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -x .xxa,.txt

we find the hidden directory /secret

and the hidden file password.xxa

ans: secret

ans: password

## Task 16

### How do you select the level of depth sqlmap should use(Higher = more accurate and more tests in general).

Took a while to find the answer to this one (i thought the answer was --crawl)

ans: --level

## Task 18

### Set the url to the machine ip, and run the command

```
kali@kali:~$ sqlmap -u 10.10.208.125 --data "msg=test" --method POST -p "msg" --level=3 --batch
